# Build package binary in debian

The cran does not provide any package binary for linux distributions. So when you install a package for the first time,
it takes long time to compile.

## Build binary and store it locally

```R
# go to the target path where you want to store the r package binary
cd /path/to/dir

# get an R terminal 
sudo R

# download the package source and build the binary
install.packages("duckdb", type = "source", INSTALL_opts = c("--build"))

# the above command will generate a .tar.gz file in the path where you run the R terminal
# for our example, you will get a file
duckdb_1.3.3_*.tar.gz

# Manually Install the Binary in Future Sessions Instead of compiling from source every time, you can install your stored binary
install.packages("/home/pliu/r_packages/duckdb_1.1.3.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source") 
```

## Prevent R from Compiling DuckDB Every Time

R may try to recompile DuckDB from source if:
- The default CRAN repository does not provide a binary.
- The package version on CRAN updates.

Solution: Set Repositories to Prefer Local Installations

Add the following line to your ~/.Rprofile to always use your prebuilt package:
options(install.packages.check.source = "no")

Or, explicitly specify type = "binary" when installing:
install.packages("duckdb", type = "binary")

If you want to completely disable source installations, set:
options(pkgType = "binary")

> R package compilation may require some system dependencies. So if the package does not compile, you need to check if 
> you have all the required system packages.
