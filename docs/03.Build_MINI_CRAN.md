# Using miniCRAN to create and maintain a local CRAN repository

You can find the official doc of the miniCRAN here : https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/miniCRAN

## Install the package miniCRAN

```shell
# install package
install.packages('miniCRAN')

# load package to current env 
library("miniCRAN")


```
## Creating the recursive dependency tree for your target packages

In this scenario, we suppose our local cran repo does not contain all R packages, so if there are dependent packages
of a package which you want to install, the target package can't be installed.

So make sure you have all the needed dependent packages is very important
```shell
# define CRAN mirror
mirror <- c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org")

# Specify list of packages to download
pkgs <- c("foreach")
depPkgList <- pkgDep(pkgs, repos = mirror, type = "source", suggests = FALSE, 
                  availPkgs = cranJuly2014)
depPkgList
```

## Create a folder to store the source and binary of the package

```shell
# Create temporary folder for miniCRAN, 
# with the below command, a folder `test_miniCRAN` will be created under /tmp
dir.create(pth <- file.path('/tmp', "test_miniCRAN"))

# Make repo for source and win.binary
# package type can be "source", "mac.binary" and "win.binary"
# the binary types can be listed and downloaded but not installed on other platforms.
makeRepo(depPkgList, path = pth, repos = mirror, type = c("source", "win.binary"))
```

## Check the downloaded packages

```shell
# List all files in miniCRAN
list.files(pth, recursive = TRUE, full.names = FALSE)

# output examples
 [1] "bin/windows/contrib/4.4/codetools_0.2-20.zip"
 [2] "bin/windows/contrib/4.4/foreach_1.5.2.zip"   
 [3] "bin/windows/contrib/4.4/iterators_1.0.14.zip"
 [4] "bin/windows/contrib/4.4/PACKAGES"            
 [5] "bin/windows/contrib/4.4/PACKAGES.gz"         
 [6] "bin/windows/contrib/4.4/PACKAGES.rds"        
 [7] "src/contrib/codetools_0.2-20.tar.gz"         
 [8] "src/contrib/foreach_1.5.2.tar.gz"            
 [9] "src/contrib/iterators_1.0.14.tar.gz"         
[10] "src/contrib/PACKAGES"                        
[11] "src/contrib/PACKAGES.gz"                     
[12] "src/contrib/PACKAGES.rds" 

# You can notice the bin and source of packages are stored in different folders

# Check for available packages with type binary of windows
pkgAvail(repos = pth, type = "win.binary")[, c(1:3, 5)]

# Check for available packages with type source
pkgAvail(repos = pth, type = "source")[, c(1:3, 5)]
```

## Adding extra package to an existing miniCRAN repository
After creating a local miniCRAN repository, additional packages and their dependencies can easily be added.

```shell
# Add new packages (from CRAN) to the miniCRAN repo
addPackage("Matrix", path = pth, repos = mirror, type = c("source"))
```

Now if you re-run the below commands, you will notice the difference, because the Matrix package only have type source

```shell
# Check for available packages with type binary of windows
pkgAvail(repos = pth, type = "win.binary")[, c(1:3, 5)]

# Check for available packages with type source
pkgAvail(repos = pth, type = "source")[, c(1:3, 5)]
```

## Install packages from your local repo

To install packages from a local repository, you need to use the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) convention file:/// to point to your file location.

```shell
# The below command will install foreach.
install.packages(pkgs, 
                 repos = paste0("file:///", pth),
                 type = "source")
```

## mirror the entire cran repo
